### Your name here

## step 1: converting units. Please complete each of these functions.
## If you need the formulas, you can find them here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/metric-imperial-conversion-charts.html

## convert miles to KM and return the result. Remove 'pass' and add your code.

## hello world

def milesToKM(miles) :
    pass

## convert kilometers to miles and return the result
def KMToMiles(km) :
    pass

## convert kilograms to pounds and return the result.

def KGToPounds(kg) :
    pass

## convert pounds to kilograms and return the result

def poundsToKG(pounds) :
    pass

## convert liters to quarts and return the result
def litersToQuarts(liters) :
    pass

## convert liters to quarts and return the result
def quartsToLiters(quarts) :
    pass


### Question 2. write a function that takes a distance in miles and a velocity in MPH
### and returns the equivalent velocity in KM/second. Make use of the functions from question 1 as necessary.

def getKMPerSecond(distanceInMiles, mph) :
    pass


### Question 3. Write a function called tooHeavy. It should take as input a weight in pounds, convert
### that to kilograms, and then return true if the object is greater than 10 kilograms, and false otherwise.
### Make use of the functions from question 1 as necessary.

def tooHeavy(weightInPounds) :
    pass

### Question 4.  Write a function that takes a list of five distances: [10 miles, 50 miles, 100 miles,
## 250 miles, 1000 miles] converts each amount to km, and then prints out how
## long it would take to travel that distance if we were traveling 110 km/hr.
### Make use of the functions from question 1 as necessary.

distanceList = [10,50,100,250,1000]

def convertListOfDistances(distanceList) :
    pass

### question 5: Extend convertListOfDistances to print out "pack a lunch!" for all the trips greater than 2 hours.

### question 6: you're done! Review the GitHub video to make sure you know how to submit your assignment,
### and then use commit and push to add it to your GitHub repo.
