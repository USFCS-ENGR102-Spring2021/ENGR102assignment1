### Assignment 1. 

### Due - Friday, Feb 19, 11:59 pm

This assignment is intended to give you some practice writing basic Python code, including functions, parameters, loops and conditionals. You'll also learn how to set up your own gitHub repo; we'll be using that to submit this assignment.

1. To begin, watch [this video](http://www.google.com), which will show you a little bit about GitHub and how to use it. 

2. Then, go to GitHub Classroom to check out the assignment. Here's the URL: 

3. For this assignment, we're going to write some functions to help us convert from English measurements to metric and back. I've provided a few empty functions to get you started.  
   Please complete each of them.

- milesToKM

- KMToMiles

- KGToPounds

- poundsToKG 

- litersToQuarts

- quartsToLiters

4.  write a function that takes a distance in miles and a velocity in MPH
and returns the equivalent velocity in KM/second.

5. Write a function called tooHeavy. It should take as input a weight in pounds,
convert that to kilograms, and then return true if the object is greater 
  than 10 kilograms, and false otherwise.
  
6 Write a function that takes a list of five distances: [10 miles, 50 miles, 100 miles, 250 miles, 1000 miles]
, converts each amount to km, and then prints out how long it would take to travel that distance if we were traveling 110 km/hr.
  
7. Extend that function to print out "pack a lunch!" for all the trips greater than 2 hours.

8. And you're done! Use git to check your code back into your repo.
